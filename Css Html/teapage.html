      <h2> When you think of high tea, is this what you picture?</h2>

        <h3>High Tea vs. Afternoon Tea</h3>
              <p>
                  Something fancy, dainty. Delicate sandwiches, tiny tea cups, crustless sadwiches. What could be more quintesentially British?
              <br><br>
                  Would it surprise you very much to know that this isn't high tea at all?
                <br><br>
                  What you are looking at is an example of <i>afternoon</i> tea. Afternoon tea is the fancy, light meal of the upper class,
                  taken in drawing rooms.
                <br><br>
                  Contrary to how it sounds to our ears, high tea is a less-fancy, heartier meal. Unlike afternoon tea, high tea is
                  served at high tables (hence the name), later in the day, and traditionally consumed by the working class (who must
                  wait until they get off work to enjoy their tea; afternoon tea is a privilege of the leisure class).

        <h3>Why the ongoing confusion?</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Mistakenly assuming "high" refers to class and not tables</li>
            <li>Never bothering to check</li>
            <li>Pintrest (and the rest of the internet) perpetuating the confusion</li>
            </ol>


       <h3>Let's go over some differences:</h3>
